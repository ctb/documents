How to get involved in Data Carpentry

We're excited to get Data Carpentry off the ground and would love participation and engagement
at any level or types. What can you do to get involved?

1) Get notified of what’s going on with Data Carpentry
- - Join the announce list
     We'll announce upcoming workshops and train-the-trainer opportunities. Train-the-trainers is being run with Software Carpentry
     and you can find out more information there.
     We will also send out a monthly newsletter with updates
  - Follow us on Twitter @datacarpentry.org
  - Check out our web site (well, you're here already). Website updates soon though.

2) Be involved in discussions on Data Carpentry materials and lessons and how to teach
  - Join the discuss list
      On the discuss list we'll discuss materials development, ways to teach and anything else of interest.
  - Join the discussion on our wiki. For topics that require more than an email discussion, we'll have a wiki page
     where everyone can contribute. Any wikis created will also be linked to on the discuss list.

3) Be a helper at a workshop
  - The first step to becoming and instructor is to help at a workshop. If there's a workshop near you, offer to be a helper
  to see if becoming an instructor is something you want to do, and to get a chance to see how Data Carpentry is being taught

4) Become an instructor
- if you are already a SWC certified instructor, you are a DC certified instructor. We will share the same training program.
There may be some on line DC modules, but those are under development. If you are a SWC instructor and would like to also be in
the pool of DC instructors, please do let us know, so we can match you to DC workshop opportunities.
- if you want to become an instructor and feel comfortable in at least two of the topic modules (spreadsheet, R or Python, SQL,
  shell), Greg Wilson is continuing to run train the trainer programs. Sign up for an online version or attend an in-person one
  if possible.
- are there a lot of people at your institute or region interested in becoming instructors? contact Greg about running a
train-the-trainers at your location.

5) Help develop materials
- as materials are maintained in github as they are for SWC, contributing to materials development is the same process
- head on over to the github repo and check out the lessons and submit pull requests
- try teaching one of the lessons as a workshop for your colleagues. Submit issues on github on what worked and didn’t
work or issue pull requests
- new to github and want to figure out how to contribute, go to docs at … Always feel free to ask for help with anything
github related. If you’re not making mistakes you’re not learning. (We think it should be the official github motto)
- want to propose a new module or work on a new domain? we’re working with SWC to develop lesson templates, so new lessons
can follow a standard format. Can’t wait for the template? Get in touch with us and tell us what you’re thinking about
and we’ll help with the development.

6) Host a workshop
- want to host a workshop - get in touch! We still want to make sure we have enough instructors to meet the workshop demand,
so we’ll work to line up instructors before we commit to running a workshop in your location.
- don’t know if you want to run a DC or SWC workshop? Email carpentry@scf.org  We’re partners! Let us know your workshop
audience or questions or concerns and we’ll help you pick the right workshop for your group.
