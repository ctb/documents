In many domains of science the rapid generation of large
amounts of data is fundamentally changing how research is done. The deluge of data presents great
opportunities, but also many challenges in managing, analyzing and
sharing data. Good training resources for researchers looking to develop
skills that will enable them to be more effective and
productive researchers are scarce. To address this need we have
developed an introductory bootcamp-style workshop, Data Carpentry,
designed to teach basic concepts, skills, and tools for working more
effectively and reproducibly with data.

Based on the successful model of Software Carpentry, Data Carpenty workshops
are intensive two-day workshops

To attain this objective, we identified the following teaching subjects.
\begin{itemize}
\item How to use spreadsheet programs (such as Excel) more effectively, and the limitations of such programs.
\item Getting data out of Excel and into more powerful tools --- using R or Python.
\item Using databases, including managing and querying data in SQL.
\item Workflows and automating repetitive tasks, in particular using the command line shell and shell scripts.
\end{itemize}

In addition to the above subjects, the following skills emerged as
particularly important to impart from our discussions about designing
the course:
\begin{itemize}
\item Preparing data for analysis.
\item Using data and computational resources, in particular publicly available ones such as Amazon Web Services or iPlant Atmosphere.
\item Conducting data and computation-heavy research more reproducibly and openly.
\end{itemize}

Although the topics for Data Carpentry overlap substantially with
those for Software Carpentry, the Data Carpentry workshop differs in
its focus, its level of expected knowledge and its domain specificity.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Data Carpentry is focused on data}. The workshop introduces one data set at the beginning of the
workshop. This data set is used throughout the workshop to teach how to manage and analyze data in an effective and reproducible way.
\item \emph{Data Carpentry is designed for novices.} There are no prerequisites, and no
prior knowledge about the tools is assumed.
\item \emph{Data Carpentry is domain specific by design.} Researchers learn better when the example used is
of a kind they are familiar with. Learners can more easily integrate new skills and information into an existing framework, and
are
