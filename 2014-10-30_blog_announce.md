We are excited to announce that Data Carpentry has received a contribution from the Moore Foundation to support its ongoing activities and growth. Data Carpentry teaches researchers skills for working more effectively with data - skills that enable the data-driven discovery being advanced by the Moore Foundation. We are thrilled to be able to contribute to creating a larger pool of researchers trained in data analysis who can advance research in all domains. 

Data Carpentry is a sister project of Software Carpentry started with funding from the NSF Science and Technology BIO Centers.  Our mission is to develop and run data skills workshops that are 1) domain specific; 2) target the fundamental data analysis and management challenges in a the given domain; and 3) require little or no prior computational experience. We have developed and taught a set of introductory workshops for biology, including working more effectively with spreadsheets, SQL for data management, and R and the command line for data analysis. The funding from the Moore Foundation enables us to scale up these efforts. We will be running more workshops, developing lessons in more domains (including social science, genomics and geosciences), training instructors, and engaging broadly in the data science community. If you are interested in being involved with Data Carpentry or attending a workshop, we have more information on our ‘how to help’ page and we would love to have you participate or be involved!

To lead these efforts the Data Carpentry board of directors has selected Dr. Tracy Teal as the project lead. Tracy has already been working on this project through her appointment at BEACON and will now have the opportunity to increase her efforts to develop and run Data Carpentry. Tracy has a background in interdisciplinary data science, computational training, and open and reproducible research. As an assistant professor at Michigan State and an NSF postdoctoral fellow in biological informatics, she has written open source bioinformatics tools and developed a research program in metagenonics and microbial ecology. She has been a Software Carpentry instructor for more than three years and developed and taught numerous workshops in bioinformatics, microbiology and statistics. She continues to be engaged in efforts on open and reproducible research as a committee member of Workflows for Reproducible Research and the International Network of Next-Generation Ecologists Open Science group. Her leadership will allow Data Carpentry to continue to expand and provide the training that ‘boots on the ground’ researchers need to do more science faster.

We’re extremely enthusiastic about the opportunity to grow Data Carpentry. With the emergence of more data and larger datasets in all domains of research, we believe that knowing how to work effectively with data can be a transformative experience for scientists. You can keep track of what we're up to through our blog, website, email list, GitHub and Twitter. We hope you’ll be a part of our efforts to train researchers in data skills to enable research progress and reproducible science.
