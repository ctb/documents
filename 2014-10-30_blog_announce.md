We are excited to announce that Data Carpentry has received a contribution from the Moore Foundation to support its ongoing activities and growth. Data Carpentry aims to teach researchers skills for working more effectively with data - skills that enable the data-driven discovery being advanced by the Moore Foundation. We are thrilled to be able to contribute to creating a larger pool of researchers trained in data analysis who can advance research in all domains. 

Data Carpentry began as an off-shoot of Software Carpentry through the NSF Science and Technology BIO Centers.  We identified the need for data skills workshops that are 1) domain specific 2) require little or no prior computational experience and 3) target the fundamental data analysis and management challenges in a given domain. With these objectives we developed and taught a set of introductory lessons first for biology, including working more effectively with spreadsheets, SQL for data management, and R and the command line for data analysis. The funding from the Moore Foundation enables us to scale these efforts. We will be looking to run more workshops, develop lessons in more domains (efforts in social science, genomics and geosciences already ongoing), train instructors and be engaged in the data science community. If you are interested in being involved with Data Carpentry or attending a workshop, we have more information on our ‘how to help’ page and we would love to have you participate or be involved! 

To lead these efforts the Data Carpentry board of directors has selected Dr. Tracy Teal as the project lead. Tracy has already been working on this project through her appointment at BEACON and will now have the opportunity to increase her efforts to develop and coordinate Data Carpentry. Tracy has a background in interdisciplinary data science, training and open and reproducible research. As an assistant professor at Michigan State and an NSF postdoctoral fellow in biological informatics, she has written open source bioinformatics tools and developed a research program in metagenonics and microbial ecology. She has been a Software Carpentry instructor for more than three years and developed and taught many workshops in bioinformatics, microbiology and statistics. She continues to be engaged in efforts on open and reproducible research as a committee member of Workflows for Reproducible Research and the International Network of Next-Generation Ecologists Open Science group. Her leadership on this project will allow Data Carpentry to expand in to other domains of research and develop with the needs of the ‘boots on the ground’ researchers in mind. 

We’re extremely enthusiastic about the opportunity to grow Data Carpentry. With the emergence of more data and larger datasets in all domains of research, we believe that a knowledge of how to work more effectively with data can be transformative. We’ll keep you posted on our efforts through our blog, website, email list, github and Twitter, so please stay tuned and we hope you’ll be a part of our efforts to train researchers in data skills to enable research progress and reproducible science.
